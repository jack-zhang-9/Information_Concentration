The initial design is a staggered DID, using the large IPO of foreign firms as an exogenous shock. I applied multiple test and altenative estimators proppsed by Goodman-Bacon(2021), Sun and Abraham (2021), Callaway and Santâ€™Anna (2021), and Borusyak et al (2021), finding that this design is unrobust when the treatment effect is heterogenous across groups and periods. This finding prompt a shift to a shift-share IV method.
